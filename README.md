# php

A personal learning repository for PHP â€” code snippets, exercises, mini-projects, notes, and resources.  
I'll push whatever I learn about PHP here so I can refer back, show progress, and build a portfolio.

# ðŸ“Œ What this repo is for
- A place to store PHP examples, small projects, exercises, and notes.
- Learn-by-doing: each folder contains a short description and runnable code.
- Track progress with a simple learning log.

# ðŸš€ Getting started (quick)
1. Install PHP (if not already). On most systems:
   - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install php`
   - Windows: install from php.net or use XAMPP/WAMP
   - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install php`
2. Run a script:
```bash
php path/to/script.php
```
