# php

A personal learning repository for PHP â€” code snippets, exercises, mini-projects, notes, and resources.  
I'll push whatever I learn about PHP here so I can refer back, show progress, and build a portfolio.

# ðŸ“Œ What this repo is for
- A place to store PHP examples, small projects, exercises, and notes.
- Learn-by-doing: each folder contains a short description and runnable code.
- Track progress with a simple learning log.

# ðŸš€ Getting started (quick)
1. Install PHP (if not already). On most systems:
   - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install php`
   - Windows: install from php.net or use XAMPP/WAMP
   - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install php`
2. Run a script:
```bash
php path/to/script.php
```
3.	For web examples, use PHPâ€™s built-in server:
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
then open http://localhost:8000

ðŸ™‹ How to contribute (if you want others to help)
	1.	Fork the repo
	2.	Create branch feat/your-thing
	3.	Add code + README.md in the relevant folder
	4.	Open a PR with description of what you added and why

ðŸ“š Resources I use
	â€¢	Official PHP docs (php.net) â€” keep as my primary reference
	â€¢	Local notes in resources/ (books, links, tutorials)
